# Vornakar World Tectonic Simulation

This is a simulation of the tectonic plate movement of a fictional world, Vornakar, over a period of 850 Mega-Annum (850 MA)

Using GPlates to simulate this time line.

## Time Scale
The entire simulation will follow the last super continent breaking up to form the modern continents of this world.

### Supercontinent Formation (850–700 MA)
* 850–800 MA: Smaller landmasses collide, suturing together through mountain-building (orogeny).
* 800–750 MA: Volcanic arcs and microcontinents are absorbed; stable cratons form.
* 750–700 MA: The supercontinent reaches its peak stability.
  
### Rifting & Early Breakup (700–500 MA)
* 700–650 MA: Rifting begins due to mantle upwelling, forming rift valleys and large inland seas.
* 650–600 MA: Initial rifts widen into narrow oceans; new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges.
* 600–500 MA: The supercontinent fully fractures into several large continents.

### Continental Drift & Collisions (500–200 MA)
* 500–400 MA: Continents drift apart, creating new ocean basins; some smaller collisions occur.
* 400–300 MA: Subduction zones develop; island arcs form and accrete to continents.
* 300–200 MA: Some continents begin new collisions, forming younger mountain ranges.

### Modern Continents Finalizing (200–0 MA)
* 200–100 MA: Continents approach their modern positions; remaining ocean basins widen.
* 100–0 MA: Tectonics slow; stable continental shelves and large-scale orogeny decline.
